# React Class Components Challenge

This project is a React application that displays basic information about people using class components. The exercises below are to be done during and after your viewing of the resources. Once completed, please push your project to a GitHub repository and provide the link to your repo.

## Challenges

### VERY EASY
Inside of your `App` class `render` method, return a `<div>` with your basic information (e.g., name, number, date of birth, etc.). This `<div>` should be hard-coded to prepare for the Medium Challenge.

### EASY
Create a `constructor` that takes in `props`, call the `super()` method, and set `this.state` to an empty object inside of the `App` class. Inside of `this.state`, create a `person` property and set it to an empty object.

### MEDIUM
Replace all of the hard-coded information with data from `this.state.person` in the constructor. Then take the returned `<div>` and create a component, pass state into it and import it as `BasicInfo`. This challenge should not change the look of the page.

### HARD
Modify the app to iterate over an array of people's basic information, while still keeping the new list of contacts in the top-level of state. (Optional: add styling to space out each person's info)
